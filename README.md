# Angular (Imam Arfianto | 2014157032)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.

## Development server
First you have to install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

#angular-laravel
- First clone via `git bash` or download.
- Go to your root folder and run this command
```
npm install
```
- After `npm install` again run this command to install `bootstrap, tether and jquery`
```
npm install bootstrap@next
```
- Download Laravel-api here : [Ganang Panggayuh | 2014157024](https://github.com/fastikom/uas-b-ganangpanggayuh), which we used as a RESTful api.
- Run your `angular` app by this command
```
ng serve -o
```
and run your `laravel` api by this command
```
php artisan serve
```
You will see this app will load data from your api.

Enjoy!
